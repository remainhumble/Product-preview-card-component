## Overview

This project is a responsive product preview card component built as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge. The goal was to recreate a visually appealing card that showcases a product, including its image, description, price, and a call-to-action button. The component adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience on both desktop and mobile devices. The implementation emphasizes semantic HTML, modern CSS (including custom properties and Sass), and accessibility best practices.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to structure a responsive product preview card component using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques like custom properties and Sass. I also practiced implementing a mobile-first workflow and ensuring accessibility by adding proper focus and hover states to interactive elements. This challenge helped reinforce my understanding of component-based design and responsive layouts.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
$textTransform: uppercase;
$Green: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
$GreenHover: hsl(158, 42%, 18%);
$White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
$Black: hsl(212, 21%, 14%);
$Grey: hsl(228, 12%, 48%);
$Cream: hsl(30, 38%, 92%);
$paragraphSize: 1rem;
$Fraunces: "Fraunces", sans-serif;
$Montserrat: "Montserrat", sans-serif;
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on:

- Improving my understanding of advanced CSS layout techniques, such as CSS Grid and container queries.
- Enhancing accessibility by learning more about ARIA roles and semantic HTML.
- Refining my use of Sass for better organization and maintainability of stylesheets.
- Practicing component-based design patterns to create more reusable and scalable UI elements.
- Deepening my knowledge of responsive design, especially for complex layouts and edge cases.
- Exploring performance optimization strategies for faster load times and better user experience.
- Experimenting with CSS animations and transitions to add subtle, engaging interactions.
- Strengthening my workflow with modern build tools and version control best practices.
